# Stock Price Predictor

## Overview
This project is a Stock Price Predictor that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and allows users to easily predict stock prices by providing a CSV file containing stock data. You can obtain stock data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and replace the file name in the code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Getting Started 
1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file (main.ipynb)
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Make sure to have the required libraries installed by running the above pip install command.
4. Obtain stock data in CSV format from Yahoo Finance or any other source.
5. Replace the file name in the notebook with the name of your downloaded CSV file.

## Usage
1. Load the necessary libraries and the CSV file containing stock data.
2. Preprocess the data, including scaling and splitting it into training and testing sets.
3. Build an LSTM model for predicting stock prices.
4. Train the model using the training set.
5. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set.
6. Plot graphs showing the predicted and actual stock prices for both the training and testing data.
7. Train Data Actual vs Predicted Graph:
